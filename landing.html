      <h2>How much money would you like to make next year?</h2>
      <p>
        Not this year, but next year – we aren’t selling bullshit. It’s going to
        take time, energy, and work to make this happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        But really, say it: How much money would you like to make next year?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you currently make less than $20/hour,
        <u
          >we want to give you a <strong>5 to 10x increase</strong> in your
          hourly pay.</u
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers with 2-4 years of experience make as much as
        <span class="underline">$120 an hour</span>. In some places like Silicon Valley,
        it’s even as much as <span class="underline">$300</span>. (An exceptional case,
        of course…)
      </p>
      <p>Time for a little story…</p>
      <p>
        I tried to pay one of my friends in tech for the kind of feedback I got
        from Fox.
      </p>
      <p>Tried to pay him $400.</p>
      <p>Know what he said to me?</p>
      <p>“Nah, I make that in half a day.”</p>
      <p>
        So he gave me the help for free – but it wasn’t as good as what Fox gave
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because what Fox did was to <span class="underline">tear me to shreds…</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Before <span class="bold">putting me back together</span> as a <span class="bold">new man.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Overlooking my resume, he asked me directly: “Is it okay if I flame
        you?”
      </p>
      <p>And <span class="underline">boy did he ever</span>.</p>
      <p>But it was worth it, because after we put my resume back together…</p>
      <p>My resume’s response rate went up <span class="bold">400%. Yes really.</span></p>
      <p>
        Suddenly I was getting <span class="bold">four times more interviews</span> than I
        had been getting the previous month. (I know because I count them.)
      </p>
      <p><span class="bold">And that’s from just the resume rewrite Fox gave me.</span></p>
      <p>After I started working with Fox, I had:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          More confidence while choosing to continue learning one programming
          language over the other. There were multiple opportunities I could
          have picked, and I didn’t know which was the best for me. People often
          face uncertainty while choosing a new learning path
        </li>
        <li>
          Fox’s presence gave me assurance that my choice would work out well. A
          greater sense of excitement in the code I was writing… because I knew
          the projects Fox had helped me choose would pay off.
        </li>
        <li>
          More motivation from seeing other people in the program do well. I
          knew that because others were seeing payoffs from their investment, I
          would too.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I said to him, “Are you sure you wanna rewrite my resume me? Redoing my
        resume wasn’t part of the bargain. I just joined your newsletter.”
      </p>
      <p>He goes, “You sent me .2 Eth.”</p>
      <p>Enough said!</p>
      <p>
        And to this day, I’m still waiting for him to run out of generosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is Fox really doing for me now? After the resume was redone,
        what is he doing for me?
      </p>
      <p>And what will Fox do for <span class="underline">you?</span></p>
      <p>Fox will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Help you choose a path forward through programming. It wont be
          uncertain whether you should choose Python, JavaScript, C++, Ruby or
          Solidity. It won’t be uncertain what those things are. Fox will be
          there to guide you to pick the best path forward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fox will guide you on the path to making a high quality portfolio that
          <span class="bold">gets you hired</span>
          <span class="underline">quickly and painlessly</span>. What do you build to
          make sure your portfolio comes out in tip top shape? The possibilities
          are endless for creating a portfolio. So many combinations! Three
          small projects, two big projects and one small one, three massive
          projects… what is the best combination of your time, energy, and
          attention?
        </li>
        <li>
          The community you’re a part of has people winning every couple of
          weeks. At least once a month we hear good news from someone in the
          community – they got hired, or got a raise at work.
          <span class="bold">That’s more motivation for you to keep going.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>What will that first $100/hr paycheck feel like in your hands?</h2>
      <p>
        You’ll go to work and know that by the time you’ve finished telling your
        team about yesterday’s accomplishments…
      </p>
      <p>You’ve already earned more than you used to in half a day.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">And then by the time you sit down to work, half an hour to an hour
        later, you’ve already earned more than you earned in a whole day.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a great feeling.
        <underline
          >Sorry, but you’ll have to get used to it. [insert fire
          emoji]</underline
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, that’s <span class="bold">really</span> what it’s like to be a senior
        developer. You show up, you tell the team what you did yesterday, what
        you want to do today, and then spend another two hours in meetings
        planning stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">By the time you even sit down to work</span>, you’ve earned more
        than you used to all day.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of the day, you’ll have earned more than you used to all
        week.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recall one programmer saying, “The first year I was a programmer, I
        had to ask myself, what am I actually going to do with all this money? I
        didn’t know where to spend it.”
      </p>
      <p>Seems like a good problem to have, no?</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>
        Ask yourself:
        <span class="underline">4-6 years from now, where do you want to be?</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Do you want to still be on the same tier of employment as flipping
        burgers, making espresso (not a bad gig by the way), and waiting tables?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or do you want to be a well respected, sought after programmer, who is
        known for making hard challenges look easy?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it’s a question of one or two years of effort to get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll have your foot in the door (meaning you’ll be in your first role)
        within two years if you’re willing and able to work with us.
      </p>
      <p>15-25 hours a week.</p>
      <p>
        If you can do your part, we can
        <span class="bold underline">guarantee</span> you get into tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust Fox: He’s seen dozens of candidates through this process. In fact,
        let’s hear from some of them right now.
      </p>
      <p>[case study one, case study two]</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>
        The absolute <span class="underline">worst case scenario</span> is that it turns
        out you can’t handle complex algorithms.
        <span class="italics">Oh noes!</span>
      </h2>
      <p>Then, guess what?</p>
      <p>
        You gravitate towards doing front-end work with user interfaces, working
        on the aesthetics of the page.
      </p>
      <p><span class="underline italics">Big deal.</span></p>
      <p><span class="bold">You’ll still be paid 6 figures.</span></p>
      <p><span class="bold">You’ll still be working 10-25 hours a week <span class="underline">from home.</span></span></p>
      <p>
        You’ll still be able to go to <span class="underline">any major city in the world</span> and find a
        hundred companies <span class="italics">just begging</span> for someone to come help them write code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mean it: front end software development is <span class="bold">an easy role</span> that <span class="bold">anyone
        can do.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        You use technologies where there is <span class="italics">very little </span>logic and complexity.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s some examples:</p>
      <!-- https://mateam.net/html-escape-characters/ -->
      <p>
        <!-- <div style=”background-color: black”>the background color is black</div>
            
            <p style=”font-size: 36px”>font size big, <span style=”font-size:14px” >font size small</span> and now back to big</p>
            
            <div width:200px height: 200px><div style=”center-everything”>centered box</div></div> -->

        See how easy that is?
      </p>
      <p>
        You can probably tell what the code does <span class="italics">just by looking at it</span> and
        you’ve <span class="italics">never written</span> a line of code before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s do another one in JavaScript, a language you’ll <span class="bold">quickly and easily</span>
        learn to read. (How do I know? You’re about to read it fine right now…)
      </p>
      <!-- https://mateam.net/html-escape-characters/ -->
      <p>
        <!-- Let x = 5
            
            Function multiplyByFive(input) {
                Return input * 5
            }
            
            console.log(multiplyByFive(5))
             -->
        What’s it print? 25. Duh.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a ludicrously simple example, but <span class="bold">take what you know and think ahead</span>: if you can read
        that, you can learn to read more complex code. <span class="bold">Trust me, <span class="underline">i’ve done it</span>.</span>
        And during my time working with Fox, I saw <span class="bold">dozens of others</span> do it too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we’re looking for our next cohort of students who are going to <span class="bold">excel</span>
        at something others said was <span class="bold">impossible</span>. Just watch: Not only will
        learning to code be <span class="bold">possible</span>, it’s actually <span class="bold">easier than you think</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        “But won’t there be times where I’m stuck and I don’t know what I’m
        doing?”
      </p>
      <p>Yes, there will be.</p>
      <p>“Doesn’t that mean I’m not cut out for coding?”</p>
      <p>
        Listen, listen. Every experienced programmer has times from as short as
        a few minutes to as long as a few weeks – recurrently – where they <span class="underline">don’t
        know</span> what the code in front of them does.
      </p>
      <p>It’s normal.</p>
      <p>It’s natural.</p>
      <p>It’s part of the game.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">In fact, we <span class="underline">guarantee</span> you’ll face tough challenges while on the path to
        riches as a software developer.</span>
      </p>
      <p><span class="bold">We don’t even want to hide it.</span></p>
      <p>
        Because we want people who are <span class="bold">up for a challenge</span> to sign up for this
        and say “Hey, let’s do it. I’m up for it. <span class="bold">I can do it.</span>”
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes they’ll be big challenges, some small ones, some that you just
        can’t handle until you come back to it in a few months. And yes, the
        journey will take time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">We aren’t selling bogus overnight transformations. This will take work.

      <h2>Won’t This Be A Really Hard Path to Follow?</h2>

      <p>
        While learning as a self-taught programmer, you often come across days,
        weeks or even months of ambiguity, uncertainty about what to do or where
        to go. You’ll come across technical challenges — “How do I learn X?”
        “Here’s my situation – where do I go?” without anyone to help you find
        the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s something you’ll <span class="italics">repeatedly</span> be able to skip over while you’re in
        this program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s a <span class="bold">real</span> story about how this community saved me time, energy, and
        reduced stresses and frustrations from weeks down to a few hours of
        discussion…
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical language aside, I was stuck on a problem I would see over and
        over again while programming:
      </p>
      <p>I had to learn a new style of coding.</p>
      <p>
        Nevermind completing a project, I had to get the first few lines
        working!
      </p>
      <p>And I was stuck.</p>
      <p>
        So I turned to the Fox System to get me past my challenges… the system
        that uses <span class="italics">special hacks in how the mind is wired to get you learning
        quickly and painlessly.</span> 
        </p>
        
      <p>
        Because… when you <span class="italics"></span>know your method works, you don’t have to worry about
        getting caught for weeks learning a new programming language. You have comfort, because...
      </p>
      

      <p>You can just <span class="underline">pick it up and go.</span></p>
      <p>(You won't believe it until you compare doing it your own way to following the system.)
    </p>
      <p><span class="underline">Here’s how the system works:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You identify what a small, little piece of the puzzle looks like. Is
          it five lines of code from the documentation? Could be. Is it taking
          1/100th of your program that you know has a simple solution available?
          If other programs must perform that particular operation regularly,
          there probably is something available. So you take that one singular
          part you <span class="bold">know</span> you can handle, and ask…
        </li>
        <li>
          How do I do this? Go to Google, go to the docs, and try your best for
          an hour –- not a week, but an hour –- and try to find out how to make
          the computer do <span class="bold">something</span> that’s a step towards your final outcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write some code yourself, and troubleshoot how it went. Diagnose for
          twenty or forty minutes. Answers start to come now.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to the community and explain your problem to other people. Provide
          links to show that you did your research. <span class="bold">95% of the time, this will
          lead you to the solution <span class="underline">before you even send a message</span>.</span>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat from step 1.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">No, there’s no secrets here. That’s <span class="underline">actually</span> what we have our students
        do.</span> And it <span class="bold underline">works</span>.
        <!-- TODO: [quotations from students, screenshots, etc.] -->
      </p>
      <p>People learn <span class="italics">fast</span> when they have this system in front of them. And even <span class="italics">faster</span> when they have no barriers to success.</p>
      <p>
        Take it. It’s yours. Everything except the final step -- where you
        use community assistance -- is yours for the taking. If you decide against investing
        in yourself today, you can still use the Five-Step Fox Solution
        Framework today to start learning code. Really. It’s that simple, and
        we’re giving it away to you, the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Go Google “learn python in x minutes” and click the “learn x in y
        minutes dot com” link. It’ll be the first one. Download the Python
        development environment onto your system and start applying that system
        right now. It’ll get you going in <span class="underline">an hour or two</span>, tops.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Yes, there will be challenges while you learn. Coding is easy, though at
        times it is also a real challenge.</span> But they are challenges you can
        overcome, no word of a lie. <span class="bold">Anyone can do it.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Think: Something like 2% of the USA’s population works in tech. That’s
        6,658,301 people. Maybe the IQ of an average programmer is 10 points
        higher than the IQ of a grocery store clerk, but it’s only 10. Some
        people with an IQ of 80 work in the field. If they can do it, you can do
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Again, <span class="italics">worst case scenario, you work in front end</span> where there are no
        complex algorithms involved… )

      <h2>Think Ahead Ten Years: What Kind of Person Will You Be Then?</h2>
      <p>There’s a fork in the road for you here.</p>
      <p>
        The version of you who becomes a programmer goes on to make 6 figs,
        sure. But what happens after year three, after year five, and in year
        ten?
      </p>
      <p>Project managers easily take home $200k a year.</p>
      <p>
        A programmer with ten years of experience is <span class="bold underline">never</span> out of a job. <span class="underline">You can
        quit working for an entire year and do nothing</span>, the industry will still
        welcome you back with open arms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, it’s a long time away, but the time <span class="bold">will</span> pass. You <span class="bold">are</span> going to be
        alive in ten years (unless you’re supremely unlucky…). Where do you want
        to be?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you want to be down on your luck, barely making ends meet, living in
        a crummy apartment… Unable to afford having friends, a family, or even a
        girlfriend?
      </p>
      <p>Or would you rather…</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Have recruiters beating their fists on your door to hire you for your
          next role
        </li>
        <li>
          Be a well respected member of an industry that is changing the world
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a choice between starting a family, retiring early, or maybe even
          doing both
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Think about the math of this decision.</p>
      <p>
        Suppose you make $20/hr right now. $20/hr * 40h/week * 50 weeks a year *
        10 years. Suppose you never get a wage increase, just to keep the math
        simple.
      </p>
      <p>That’s $<span class="underline">400,000</span>.</p>
      <p>Now suppose you get hired as a programmer a year from now.</p>
      <p>
        $25/hr your first year. $35/hr your second. $60/hr your third. $100/hr
        by your fifth.
      </p>
      <p>$25/h * 40h/wk * 50 weeks * 1 year = $50,000</p>
      <p>$35/h * 40h/wk * 50 weeks * 1 year = $70,000</p>
      <p>$60/h * 40h/wk * 50 weeks * 2 year = $240,000</p>
      <p>$100/h * 40h/wk * 50 weeks * 5 years = $1,000,000 ← years 5 to 10</p>
      <p>
        That’s $<span class="underline">1,360,000 in ten years, versus $400,000 if you turn this down</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the work is unpleasant at $20/hour. I know because I’ve been there.
        You know because you’re there now.
      </p>
      <p>As a programmer, <span class="bold">you just don’t work that hard</span>.</p>
      <p>
        So do you want to make 3x more this decade… Just by putting in one or
        two years of additional work?
      </p>
      <p>Watch this now, we’ll do the math for the next decade.</p>
      <p>
        $120/hour * 40h/wk * 50 weeks * 10 years = $2,400,000. Yes really.
        You’ll make <span class="bold underline">six times the amount you’ll make if you don’t do this</span>.
        $120/hour with ten or even five years of programming experience is
        completely reasonable.

      <h2>This is your path to financial freedom.</h2>
      <p>But you have to reach out and grab it.</p>
      <p>Yes, we’re asking you to invest in yourself.</p>
      <p>
        Fox is here to guide you and help you along the way… But ultimately <span class="bold">it’s
        up to you to take the first step by signing up</span>. And Fox is one man.
      </p>
      <p>
        He doesn’t have enough time to take on more than <span class="underline"> ten additional
        students</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wants to give every person <span class="underline">three one-on-one hours a month</span> plus <span class="underline">two
        hours per week</span> from a member of the team. (You do the math. 3 hours per
        month * 10 people = 30 per month.)
      </p>
      <p><span class="underline">Be one of the few!</span></p>
      <p>For only $300/month you’ll get…</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One on one assistance and direction from our community support staff.
        </li>
        <li>
          An employment specialist overseeing your progress. YOu’ll know if
          you’re making good time. You’ll know if you’re 6 months away, or 3
          months. <span class="bold">You’ll have confidence in your learning</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Help overcoming technical challenges that you face on the path to
          success. Why spend 30 hours on a problem when you could talk to the
          staff and spend <span class="bold">three</span>?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We encourage you to pay upfront in one lump sum.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="italics">It’s not about us – it’s about <span class="bold">you</span></span>, and what kind of commitment you are
